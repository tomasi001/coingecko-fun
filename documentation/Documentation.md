# Step 1: Full Documentation

## Purpose

- **Summary (Client Requirement):** Set up an API and database infrastructure to display token data for Ethereum and Aver AI. This includes frontend and backend development, integration with external APIs, and implementing caching and testing mechanisms.
- **Detailed Goal:** Develop a standalone, full-stack application that provides real-time token data (price and OHLC) for Ethereum and Aver AI, integrating with the CoinGecko API. The system will leverage MongoDB Atlas for persistent storage, Redis for caching, and a TypeScript-based backend with a Next.js frontend to deliver a performant, scalable, and user-friendly experience.
- **Problem Solved:** Crypto enthusiasts and traders need reliable, real-time access to Ethereum and Aver AI token data without delays or excessive reliance on external APIs. The caching layer reduces load on CoinGecko, ensuring efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
- **Value Provided:** Accurate, up-to-date price data and 7-day OHLC charts delivered every 30 seconds, with an interactive frontend and a robust backend capable of handling 10K+ concurrent users.
- **Scope:**
  - Limited to Ethereum and Aver AI tokens (no additional tokens planned).
  - Includes frontend (Next.js, TailwindCSS), backend (TypeScript), database (MongoDB Atlas), caching (Redis), and integration with CoinGecko API.
  - Standalone product, not part of a larger ecosystem.

## Users

- **Primary Users:** Crypto enthusiasts and traders.
  - **Demographics:** All user demographics, including casual users checking prices and professional traders analyzing OHLC trends. Assumed to have varying technical skill levels (beginners to tech-savvy).
  - **Goals:**
    - View real-time token data for Ethereum and Aver AI updated every 30 seconds.
    - Analyze 7-day OHLC data via an interactive chart.
    - Experience a fast, responsive interface with no direct dependency on external APIs.
  - **Success Metrics:** Data refreshes every 30 seconds, chart interactivity (e.g., zoom, toggle between tokens), and minimal latency even with 10K+ concurrent users.
- **Secondary Users:** Administrators.
  - **Characteristics:** Technical staff or developers responsible for system maintenance.
  - **Goals:**
    - Monitor system performance, including errors, API usage, and cache status.
    - Ensure data pipeline (CoinGecko → MongoDB → Redis → Frontend) operates smoothly.
  - **Interface:** Requires a separate interface (e.g., dashboard or API endpoints) for monitoring and logs.

## Typical User Workflows

- **Workflow 1: Viewing Real-Time Token Data (Primary User)**
  1. User navigates to the frontend page (built with Next.js and styled with TailwindCSS).
  2. Page loads and establishes a connection to the backend for real-time updates.
  3. Backend serves real-time token data (price) for Ethereum and Aver AI, sourced from Redis cache (updated every 30 seconds).
  4. Frontend displays the data in a clear, readable format (e.g., a table or card layout).
  5. An interactive chart renders 7 days of OHLC data for both tokens, fetched from the backend (sourced from MongoDB Atlas).
  6. User interacts with the chart (e.g., zooms in, toggles between Ethereum and Aver AI).
  7. Data refreshes automatically every 30 seconds, maintaining the critical 30-second update cycle.
  8. Frontend exclusively requests data from the backend, never directly from CoinGecko.
- **Workflow 2: System Monitoring (Administrator)**
  1. Administrator accesses a separate interface (e.g., a Next.js admin page or dedicated API endpoints).
  2. Interface displays logs and monitoring data, including:
     - Error logs (e.g., failed API calls, connection issues).
     - CoinGecko API usage (e.g., call frequency, rate limit status).
     - Redis cache performance (e.g., hit/miss ratio, update frequency).
     - MongoDB write/read success rates.
  3. Administrator reviews metrics and takes action if anomalies are detected (e.g., clears cache, investigates API downtime).
- **Notes:**
  - The 30-second refresh rate is critical and must be adhered to for both cache updates and frontend display.
  - Chart interactivity is limited to basic features (e.g., zoom, toggle); no additional features (e.g., historical data beyond 7 days) are required.

## Dependencies

- **Frontend Requirements (Client-Specified):**
  - **Framework:** Next.js (React-based) for server-side rendering and static site generation, paired with TailwindCSS for responsive, utility-first styling.
  - **Functionality:**
    - Build a single page to display real-time token data for Ethereum and Aver AI (layout to reference a provided "left page" design, assumed to be a mockup).
    - Create a chart using OHLC data returned from the backend, covering the last 7 days.
    - Refresh and populate data every 30 seconds via a connection to the backend.
    - Frontend must request data exclusively from the backend, notdirectly from CoinGecko.
  - **Augmented Details:** Chart must be interactive (e.g., zoom, toggle between tokens).
- **Backend Requirements (Client-Specified):**
  - **Language:** TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
  - **Configuration:** Properly configure CORS to allow frontend access.
  - **Functionality:**
    - Fetch and format OHLC data from CoinGecko API for Ethereum and Aver AI.
    - Serve data via HTTP or WebSocket (depending on efficiency for 10K+ concurrent users).
    - Ensure efficient handling of multiple concurrent requests (10K+ users).
  - **Augmented Details:**
    - Backend implemented within the Next.js ecosystem for simplicity and deployment compatibility.
- **Database Requirements (Client-Specified):**
  - **Technology:** MongoDB Atlas for cloud-hosted, persistent storage.
  - **Functionality:** Store price data every 1 minute, overwriting the previous record for each token (Ethereum and Aver AI).
  - **Schema (Inferred):**
    - Document structure: `{ token: string, price: number, timestamp: Date }`.
    - One document per token, updated every minute.
- **Caching Requirements (Client-Specified):**
  - **Technology:** Redis as a caching layer.
  - **Functionality:** Update token information every 30 seconds to improve performance and reduce load on CoinGecko API.
  - **Details (Inferred):**
    - Cache keys: e.g., `ethereum:price`, `averai:price` for real-time data.
    - Cache TTL: 30 seconds, refreshed from CoinGecko or MongoDB if stale.
- **External APIs (Client-Specified):**
  - **CoinGecko API:**
    - Purpose: Retrieve real-time token data and OHLC data for Ethereum and Aver AI.
    - API Key: `CG-32JARN2FnAhPKaq9X68XARkg`.
    - Endpoints (Inferred):
      - `/coins/markets` for price data.
      - `/coins/{id}/ohlc` for 7-day OHLC data.
    - Rate Limits: Must be mitigated via Redis caching (exact limits TBD based on CoinGecko documentation).
- **Test Requirements (Client-Specified):**
  - **Automated Tests:**
    - **API Endpoints:** Validate connections, data formatting, and response times.
    - **Database Operations:** Confirm MongoDB write (every 1 minute) and read accuracy.
    - **Redis Caching:** Verify 30-second update cycle and cache consistency.

  - **Tools (Inferred):** Jest for unit/integration tests.
- **Deployment (Augmented):**
  - **Platform:** Vercel for both frontend and backend (via Next.js API routes for MVP simplicity).
  - **Rationale:**
    - Blazing fast performance with Next.js optimizations and edge network.
    - Free tier supports MVP deployment.
    - Simplified setup by keeping frontend and backend in one Next.js project.

## Non-Functional Requirements

  - Frontend refreshes and populates data every 30 seconds.
  - Backend serves OHLC data for the last 7 days in an interactive chart.
  - System supports 10K+ concurrent users.
