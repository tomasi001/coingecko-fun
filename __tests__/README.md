# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach for the Aver application.

## Test Structure

The test suite is organized into the following categories:

- **API Tests**: Validate that API endpoints correctly handle requests, responses, and error cases
- **Security Tests**: Ensure proper input validation and protection against common attacks
- **Library Tests**: Test core functionality of MongoDB and Redis connections
- **Utility Tests**: Validate helper functions and shared utilities

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate test coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## Mocking Strategy

The tests use Jest mocks to isolate components and simulate dependencies:

- **Next.js**: The Next.js framework components are mocked in `__tests__/__mocks__/next.tsx`
- **External APIs**: API calls to CoinGecko and other services are mocked
- **Database Connections**: MongoDB and Redis connections are mocked to prevent actual database operations

## Current Test Coverage

The test suite currently focuses on backend functionality with the following coverage:

- ✅ API endpoint response validation
- ✅ Token data retrieval and caching
- ✅ Security input validation
- ✅ MongoDB connection and operations
- ✅ Redis caching operations
- ✅ Error handling

## Areas for Improvement

The following areas need additional test coverage:

1. **Frontend Components**: Add unit tests for React components
2. **End-to-End Tests**: Implement Cypress or Playwright tests for full application flows
3. **User Authentication**: Add tests for login, registration, and authorization
4. **Performance Tests**: Add load testing for critical API endpoints
5. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between multiple systems

## Best Practices

When adding new tests:

1. Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions
2. Create meaningful test descriptions that explain what is being tested
3. Use the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
4. Mock external dependencies to keep tests isolated
5. Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details
6. Ensure tests run quickly and don't have side effects

## Common Issues

- **Punycode Deprecation Warning**: This is a known issue with the current Node.js version and can be safely ignored
- **MongoDB Connection Errors**: Make sure the test MongoDB URI is properly configured
- **Redis Connection Timeouts**: Ensure Redis mock is properly configured in each test suite
