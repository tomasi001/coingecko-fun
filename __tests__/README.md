# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach for the Aver AI Token Data Application.

## Test Structure

The test suite is organized into:

- **API Tests**: Validate API endpoints for correct handling of requests and responses
- **Security Tests**: Ensure protection against injection attempts and malformed requests
- **Library Tests**: Validate MongoDB and Redis functionality
- **Utility Tests**: Test helper functions and shared utilities

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:watch    # Run in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report
```

## Mocking Strategy

- **Next.js**: Framework components mocked in `__tests__/__mocks__/next.tsx`
- **External APIs**: CoinGecko API calls mocked
- **Database**: MongoDB and Redis connections mocked

## Current Coverage

- ✅ API endpoint validation
- ✅ Token data retrieval and caching
- ✅ Security input validation
- ✅ MongoDB and Redis operations
- ✅ Error handling

## Areas for Improvement

1. Frontend component tests
2. End-to-end tests with Cypress or Playwright
3. Performance/load testing for critical endpoints
4. Integration tests between systems

## Testing Best Practices

1. Follow existing structure and naming conventions
2. Create meaningful test descriptions
3. Use the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
4. Mock external dependencies
5. Focus on behavior, not implementation details

## Troubleshooting

- **MongoDB Connection Errors**: Verify test MongoDB URI configuration
- **Redis Connection Timeouts**: Ensure Redis mock is properly configured
