This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Automated Tests

The project includes comprehensive automated tests for API endpoints, database operations, Redis caching, and security. To run tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
npm run test:watch

# Generate test coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite currently covers the critical infrastructure components:

- MongoDB connection and data operations
- Redis caching mechanisms
- API endpoints (error handling and happy paths)
- Security validations for malicious inputs

Areas that require additional test coverage include:

- Frontend components and UI interactions
- Integration tests for the full application flow
- CoinGecko API interaction layer

For more details about the testing strategy, see [**tests**/README.md](./__tests__/README.md).
